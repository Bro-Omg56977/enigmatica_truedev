 WIP expansion to the saturated pack


fun fact: Saturated was originally spupposed to be about... 3x bigger. saturated itself was maybe only 1 of the 3 main dimensions that was supposed to be added (excluding the void)

Saturated was, at the beginning, going to include a generic overworld-like dimension, a generic end-like dimension, and a generic nether-like dimension

Saturated ended up being the overworld-like dimension, whilst the other 2 were scrapped due to lack of biome ideas, time constrainsts, among other things

(reference to the low-quality dimensional connections.png)

Enigmatica was later toyed around with for a little "datapack project" which i was involved with. it was a group of small datapack creators (including me, humanoid, limesplatus, and a few others) got together to try and release actually good datapacks to fight back against the "minecraft, but..." wave. it ultimatly failed because we all lost motivation, and the only thing that was released was "minecraft but i farted" (yes, that's a read pack released by _hhumanoid. it made the world really ugly as a troll)

which leads to... now, i guess. Enigmatica will probably not be my priority for awhile, instead being on a backburner for when i suddenly get motivation to work on it. it'll probably be similar in vibes to saturated
